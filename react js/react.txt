Basic Interview Questions Of React : ...
answer 1 ---
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It lets developers create reusable UI components that update dynamically as data changes.

Why React is Used:
Component-Based: React breaks the UI into small, reusable pieces (components), making code more organized and manageable.
Fast Rendering: React uses a "virtual DOM" to efficiently update only parts of the page that need changes, making it fast.
Unidirectional Data Flow: Data flows one way, making it easier to understand and debug complex applications.

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like code within JavaScript. Itâ€™s commonly used in React to describe what the UI should look like.

Why JSX is Preferred in React:
Readability: JSX makes the code easier to read and write by combining HTML-like syntax directly with JavaScript logic.
Component Structure: JSX closely resembles the structure of the UI, making it easier to visualize and manage components.
JSX Compilation: Under the hood, JSX is compiled to JavaScript, making it fast and optimized for React.

Key Differences:
JavaScript Expressions: In JSX, you can embed JavaScript expressions inside {} brackets (e.g., {2 + 2}).
Attributes: JSX uses camelCase for attributes instead of HTML's lowercase (e.g., className instead of class, onClick instead of onclick).
Self-Closing Tags: All tags must be closed, even single elements (e.g., <img />, <br />).
JavaScript Logic: JSX is not HTML but compiles to JavaScript, so you can include conditionals and loops directly within JSX.
