Basic Interview Questions Of React : ...
answer 1 ---
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It lets developers create reusable UI components that update dynamically as data changes.

Why React is Used:
Component-Based: React breaks the UI into small, reusable pieces (components), making code more organized and manageable.
Fast Rendering: React uses a "virtual DOM" to efficiently update only parts of the page that need changes, making it fast.
Unidirectional Data Flow: Data flows one way, making it easier to understand and debug complex applications.



answer 2---
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It’s commonly used in React to describe what the UI should look like.

Why JSX is Preferred in React:
Readability: JSX makes the code easier to read and write by combining HTML-like syntax directly with JavaScript logic.
Component Structure: JSX closely resembles the structure of the UI, making it easier to visualize and manage components.
JSX Compilation: Under the hood, JSX is compiled to JavaScript, making it fast and optimized for React.



answer 3---
Key Differences:
JavaScript Expressions: In JSX, you can embed JavaScript expressions inside {} brackets (e.g., {2 + 2}).
Attributes: JSX uses camelCase for attributes instead of HTML's lowercase (e.g., className instead of class, onClick instead of onclick).
Self-Closing Tags: All tags must be closed, even single elements (e.g., <img />, <br />).
JavaScript Logic: JSX is not HTML but compiles to JavaScript, so you can include conditionals and loops directly within JSX.



answer 4---
Components are the building blocks of a React application. Each component is a self-contained piece of UI that represents part of the web page, like a button, form, or header.

Key Points:
Reusable: Components can be reused across the app, making code more modular.
Independent: Each component handles its own structure, logic, and styling.
Types: Components can be functional (simple functions) or class-based (use ES6 classes).



answer 5---
Functional components and class components are two ways to define components in React, each with different syntax and features.

Functional Components:
Simple functions that take props as an argument and return JSX.
Use React Hooks (like useState, useEffect) to manage state and lifecycle.
Preferred for simplicity and readability.

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

Class Components:
ES6 classes that extend React.Component.
Manage state and lifecycle methods (like componentDidMount) within the class.
Were commonly used before hooks but are now less popular.

class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}



answer 6---
A Single-Page Application (SPA) is a web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without reloading the whole page. This makes SPAs faster and smoother, providing a more app-like experience.

How React Enables SPAs:
Virtual DOM: React uses the virtual DOM to update only parts of the page that need changes, improving performance.
Component-Based Structure: React organizes the UI into components, making it easy to load and update specific sections.
React Router: React Router enables navigation between "pages" (components) without reloading, giving the appearance of multiple pages within a single page.



answer 7---
Props (short for "properties") are inputs that allow data to be passed from a parent component to a child component in React. They make components more dynamic by allowing you to customize their content.

Key Points:
Read-Only: Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed by the child component.
Passed from Parent to Child: Data flows from parent to child, enabling a one-way data flow.
Used to Render Dynamic Data: Props make components reusable by allowing different data to be displayed.

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

// Usage in Parent Component
<Greeting name="Alice" />




answer 8---
Key Differences:
Ownership:

State is managed within a component itself, allowing it to change over time.
Props are passed from a parent component to a child and cannot be changed by the child.
Mutability:

State is mutable and can be updated with setState (in class components) or useState (in functional components).
Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the receiving component.
Usage:

State is for data that changes within a component, like user input or UI behavior.
Props are for passing static or parent-defined data to children components.


answer 9---
Common Methods:
Parent to Child:

Pass data from a parent component to a child component through props.

function Parent() {
  const message = "Hello from Parent!";
  return <Child text={message} />;
}

function Child(props) {
  return <p>{props.text}</p>;
}

Child to Parent:

Pass data up by using a callback function provided by the parent.

function Parent() {
  const handleData = (data) => {
    console.log("Data from child:", data);
  };
  return <Child sendData={handleData} />;
}

function Child(props) {
  return <button onClick={() => props.sendData("Hello Parent!")}>Send Data</button>;
}

Key Prop in Lists
The key prop in React is crucial for efficiently rendering lists. Each item in a list needs a unique key to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. This allows React to optimize rendering and minimize unnecessary updates.

const items = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];

function ItemList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}



answer 11---

In React, handling events is similar to handling events in regular JavaScript, but with some syntax differences.

Basic Steps:
Attach Event Handler:

Add an event attribute (e.g., onClick, onChange) to an element, assigning it a function.
Event names are camelCase in React (e.g., onClick instead of onclick).
Define Event Handler Function:

The function can be defined in the component to handle the event action.
Pass Event Object (if needed):

Event handlers automatically receive the event object as a parameter.

function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}




answer 12---
Controlled Components:
State-Driven: The input’s value is controlled by React state.
Two-Way Binding: The input’s value updates through a value prop and an onChange handler.

function Form() {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <input 
      type="text" 
      value={name} 
      onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} 
    />
  );
}


Uncontrolled Components:
DOM-Driven: The input’s value is managed by the DOM, not React.
Ref Access: You access the value directly using a ref.

function Form() {
  const inputRef = React.useRef();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert(inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </div>
  );
}




answer 13---
A React Fragment is a wrapper component that lets you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM, which helps keep your HTML structure cleaner.

Why Use React Fragments:
Avoids Extra Markup: Fragments prevent the need to add unnecessary divs or other elements just for grouping.
Improves Performance: Fewer DOM nodes mean a lighter and faster-rendering component.
Syntax: You can use <React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment> or simply <>...</> for shorthand.
function List() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </>
  );
}




answer 14---
In React, you can conditionally render elements using JavaScript logic inside JSX. Here are some common ways to do it:

1. Using Ternary Operator:
function Welcome(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {props.isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please log in</h1>}
    </div>
  );
}


2. Using if Statement:
You can use a regular if statement before returning JSX.
function Greeting(props) {
  let message;
  if (props.isLoggedIn) {
    message = <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
  } else {
    message = <h1>Please log in</h1>;
  }
  return <div>{message}</div>;
}




answer 15---
React Hooks are functions that allow you to use React features, like state and lifecycle methods, in functional components. Before hooks, these features were only available in class components.

Commonly Used React Hooks:
useState:
Used to add state to functional components.
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);






Intermediate Interview Questions Of React:.....................
answer 1---
Key Points:
Initial State: You provide an initial value to useState (e.g., 0, "", or an object).
State and Setter: useState returns two values:
The current state value.
A setter function to update the state.

const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  // Initial state is 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}
