Basic Interview Questions Of React : ...
answer 1 ---
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It lets developers create reusable UI components that update dynamically as data changes.

Why React is Used:
Component-Based: React breaks the UI into small, reusable pieces (components), making code more organized and manageable.
Fast Rendering: React uses a "virtual DOM" to efficiently update only parts of the page that need changes, making it fast.
Unidirectional Data Flow: Data flows one way, making it easier to understand and debug complex applications.
