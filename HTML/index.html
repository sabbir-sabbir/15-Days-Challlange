  HTML tags are the building blocks of web pages. They are pieces of code, usually written inside angle brackets like <tag>, that tell a web browser how to display content.
    5 tags example are below                         
 -->
 <h1> - Heading 1 (largest heading)
    <h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>

<p> - Paragraph    
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>


<a> - Anchor (used for links)  
    <a href="https://example.com">Click here to visit Example</a>


<img> - Image 
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">


<ul> and <li> - Unordered List and List Item
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
      </ul>

      


<!--                          Answer number 3
 The <html> tag is the root element that wraps all the HTML content on a webpage. Inside it, the <head> tag contains meta-information about the page, like the title, character set, and links to stylesheets or scripts. The <body> tag holds all the content that will be displayed to the user, such as text, images, and links.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is placed at the very top of the HTML file and tells the browser to use the latest HTML standards for displaying the page. It’s not a tag but an instruction for proper rendering.

   The <title> tag defines the title of an HTML document. This title appears on the browser tab when the page is open, and it is also used by search engines as the page title in search results.                              

example below
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Welcome to My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
<!-- In this example, "Welcome to My Website" will appear as the title on the browser tab. -->

 <!-- This is a comment and will not be displayed in the browser -->
 Why Comments Are Useful:
 Explain Code: ---They help developers understand what specific sections of the code do, making it easier to read.
 Leave Notes: ---They can be used as reminders for future updates or improvements.
 Debugging: ---You can temporarily "hide" code by commenting it out for testing without deleting it.

An HTML element is a complete piece of HTML code, typically consisting of a start tag, content, and an end tag. An HTML attribute, on the other hand, is extra information added to an HTML element's start tag to define its properties or behavior.

<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>


Element: ----<a>...</a> is an anchor (link) element.
Attributes: ----href="https://example.com" and target="_blank" are attributes that specify the link's URL and set it to open in a new tab.

<!--                                          Answer number 7
 Global attributes in HTML can be used on any HTML element. They provide additional information or functionality that can enhance the way elements are styled or behave. 
 
 example below

 1.Class
 The class attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an element, allowing you to apply CSS styles to multiple elements at once.
 <p class="important">This is an important paragraph.</p>


2. id
The id attribute provides a unique identifier for an element, which can be used for styling with CSS or for targeting with JavaScript.
<h1 id="main-title">Welcome to My Website</h1>


3. style
The style attribute allows you to apply inline CSS styles directly to an element, overriding any styles from external stylesheets.
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 20px;">This text is blue and larger.</p>


4. title
The title attribute provides additional information about an element, often displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the element.
<a href="https://example.com" title="Visit Example Website">Example</a>




-->



<!--                               Answer number 8
 The alt attribute in an <img> tag provides alternative text for an image and some important purposes such as                               
Accessibility: It helps visually impaired users understand the content of the image by providing a description that can be read by screen readers.

SEO: Search engines use the alt text to better understand the context of the image, which can improve search engine optimization.

Fallback Content: If the image fails to load for any reason (like a broken link), the alt text will be displayed in its place, giving users context about what should have been there.

<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset over the mountains">

<!--                                         Answer number 10
 The target attribute in an <a> (anchor) tag specifies how the linked document should be opened when the link is clicked. It defines the browsing context in which the linked resource will be displayed.  
    
    _blank: This value opens the link in a new tab or window. It’s useful when you want to keep the current page open while allowing users to view the linked content.

    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

    <!-- <link rel="icon" href="favicon.png" type="image/png"> -->
</head>

Why Add a Favicon?
Branding: A favicon helps establish your brand identity, making your site more recognizable.

Usability: It enhances the user experience by making it easier for users to find your site in their browser tabs and bookmarks.

Professional Appearance: A website with a favicon appears more polished and complete, contributing to overall professionalism.

1. Block Elements
Block elements take up the full width available (by default) and start on a new line. They are typically used for larger sections of content. Block elements can contain other block elements and inline elements.

Examples of Block Elements:----
<div>: A generic container for grouping elements.
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.: Headings of different levels.
<p>: Paragraphs of text.
<ul>, <ol>, <li>: Lists.
                           
    
 2. Inline Elements
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are typically used for smaller pieces of content within block elements. Inline elements can contain only text and other inline elements but not block elements.

Examples of Inline Elements:----
<span>: A generic inline container for text.
<a>: Anchor links.
<img>: Images.
<strong>: Strong emphasis (bold).
<em>: Emphasis (italic).

     Linking CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to HTML is essential for styling web pages. There are several methods to include CSS in your HTML document, but the most common ways are:

1. External CSS
Using an external stylesheet is the most recommended method for maintaining clean and manageable code. Here’s how to do it:

Steps:

Create a CSS file (e.g., styles.css).
In your HTML document, use the <link> tag inside the <head> section to link the CSS file.
    example...
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
         <title>My Web Page</title>


2. Internal CSS
You can also include CSS directly within an HTML document using the <style> tag. This method is useful for small projects or specific pages where you don’t want to create a separate CSS file.
    
    example...
    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: lightblue;
        }
        h1 {
            color: white;
            text-align: center;
        }
    </style>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>

<section>
    Why: It divides content into meaningful sections within a page, helping structure complex layouts intuitively. It keeps everything organized and improves accessibility.

    <article>
    Why: Perfect for independent, self-contained content like blog posts, news articles, or product descriptions. It’s easy to retrieve in layouts, ensuring structured content that can stand alone.


    <header> and <footer>
    Why: These tags are essential for wrapping site-wide headers and footers, like navigation menus, titles, and copyright info. They make sections look cohesive while improving screen reader navigation.


    <nav>
    Why: It specifically defines a navigation section for links, keeping the structure clean and helping users navigate a site easily. Screen readers recognize it as the site’s main navigation, enhancing accessibility.


    <figure> and <figcaption>
    Why: The perfect combo for displaying images with descriptive captions, particularly for articles, portfolios, or media-rich content. They make multimedia elements feel more integrated and visually organized.


    <details> and <summary>
    Why: Simple yet powerful for creating collapsible sections! Great for FAQs or any interactive area, saving users from unnecessary JavaScript and making content management easy.


    <table>
    Why: Tables are fantastic for displaying tabular data. Combined with <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>, they create well-organized, accessible tables with headers and footers that structure data cleanly.


    <form>
    Why: The backbone of web interactivity. Forms capture user data and include various elements like text inputs, buttons, checkboxes, and more. It’s crucial for interactive websites, from surveys to online purchases.


    <input>
    Why: It’s super versatile, handling text, numbers, dates, files, and checkboxes. It’s customizable and provides the core of user input, making it indispensable in web forms.


    <a>
    Why: The anchor tag is what makes the web interconnected. It’s simple yet incredibly powerful, enabling everything from internal navigation to external linking and document downloads.
